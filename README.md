Find the closest cafeteria near you. A summer project from 2016.
## What API keys you may need

* Google AdMob (for ads)

## What this project taught me
* Difference between static and non-static
* Dealing with JSON and web APIs in general
* How fragments work

## Bugs to expect
They are likely. It's been two years - I don't remember exactly what was going wrong. In addition, this project is really old, so it may fail due to stuff being depreceated in the meantime.
